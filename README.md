# beerquest-engineering-challenge

## The Challenge
The core data for this challenge is based on pubs around Leeds. The raw data can be found
here and is based around the Leeds Beer Quest
X-Lab would like to build an application using this data, that presents information about pubs
in and around Leeds to their staff so that they can choose an appropriate post-work watering
hole based on their location, rating and services offered.
This challenge can be attempted in one of 3 ways, depending on core discipline.
- **Front end focussed:** Use the API provided at https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/leeds-beer-quest
(this wraps the above dataset) to build a front end application to present this
dataset in a searchable manner to end users
- **Back end focussed:** Using the above dataset, build an API that can be used by front end
applications.
- **Infrastructure focussed:** Deliver a working infrastructure to house all components of the system. We
will provide base containers on request, or you may use your own.
